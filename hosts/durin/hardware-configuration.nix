  Placeholder `hardware-configuration.nix` for `durin`.

  `hosts/bert/hardware-configuration.nix` or your target machine's generated
  `hardware-configuration.nix`) and replace this file's contents.

  If durin is a Linode/VM, use the Linode-specific hardware file. If it's a
  Raspberry Pi, copy the Pi hardware config and re-enable the Pi module in
  `default.nix` imports as needed.
